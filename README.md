This repo contains my submissions to various topcoder development challenges.  I have competed in 4 challenges so far, the directories in this repo correspond to each challenge.  My topcoder name is [*kyrra*](http://community.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&cr=40073405).

Along with coding TopCoder challenges, I was given the opportunity to be a reviewer for one challenge:
